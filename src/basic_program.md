# Basic Program

```rust,editable
{{#include ../listings/listing-01-01/src/main.rs}}
```

In the code, the fn keyword declares the proceeding code as a function, main is the name of the function, the parentheses provide space for the function's arguments, of which there are none, the curly brackets contain the function's code, and the println! macro outputs an important and under-appreciated message to the user's terminal when the user runs the compiled binary file.
