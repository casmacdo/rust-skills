# Memory Allocation

Efficency is a primary concern in Rust's memory allocation logic. Rust stores information using two types of memory: the stack and the heap.

One may visulize the stack as pancakes that we and our older brother sequentially weigh, stack, and unstack. Further, we can imagine that our older brother's contamination OCD compels him to put us in a headlock each time we try to take pancakes from locations on the stack other than the top.
