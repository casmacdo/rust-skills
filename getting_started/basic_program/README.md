# The file titled _main.rs_ in this folder contains a basic program that I compiled using the Rust compiler.

_main.rs_ contains a basic function that outputs a string to the command line. Here is the code:

```Rust

fn main()
{
    println!("Cassidy has giant quads")
}

```

In the code, the fn keyword declares the proceeding code as a function, main is the name of the function, the parentheses provide space for the function's arguments, of which there are none, the curly brackets contain the function's code, and the println! macro outputs an important and under-appreciated message to the user's terminal when the user runs the code.
